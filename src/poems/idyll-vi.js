const text = `"Your eyes are as
The brackish waters
Of Cefalu
Beneath your gaze
Green fear seizes me"
She reads
Almost turns green herself
Not with fear but from
The second-hand embarrassment of
The naive audacity inhabiting
Her hopeless amator –
Amateur poet that he is:
"Yours, yours, yours,
Polyphemus"
"Cefalu," she scoffs
They went to Rockaway once –
He got sunburned on the boardwalk
And whined the whole way back
Her cursor lingers on the screen
She clicks below the body and writes:


"You loved a girl who never existed.
Sometimes I miss her.”
The cursor blinks
She lingers there, for a second,
Trying to recall a line he wrote once
Then spills out
“Your prettiest remorse,
Galatea"
She hits 'Send'
Imagining him
White-collared
Maybe shirtless
Untrimmed in grey
Sweltering in an aging co-op
Romanticising Werther
Retaliating Theocritus
At thirty-seven
Outside her window the N train
Rumbles into the station
There was a time when she lived
On 48th and Broadway
A few blocks away from Schoenfeld theatre


Wishful thinking in hindsight
She got her break
On an off-Broadway production of
The Last Five Years
(Not that it ever belonged on-Broadway)
Cathy, of course
Of course, Cathy
Manic hope in a whiny vessel Cathy
Spiral-bound backwards as she sings
The audience falls in love with
An image of her
A story that only makes sense in hindsight
It's a sad song
But we still sing it;
The best stories are not always
Those that end happily
It happened that
Outside there was a man with flowers
And a box of letters addressed to her
They gather dust in the supply closet of
Her one-bed in Astoria
Over the water by the park hangs
The Hell's Gate bridge


In summer sometimes she lounges there
In a pink floral dress
And takes her students out to sing
On the green grass seas of the evening
