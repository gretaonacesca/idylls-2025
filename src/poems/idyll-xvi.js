const text = `"The poet has the curse
Of never being able to say
Exactly what he wants
Even these idylls
Are painted in muted colours
No one exists anywhere
And yet the city somewhere has
The multiplicity of archetypes
And I want to say
'Shall I say I have gone at dusk
Through narrow streets
And watched the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt sleeves
Leaning out of windows'
I should have died in a rain-soaked
November trench in Belgium
A century ago
But now I write code for a living
From a WeWork
In lower Manhattan
And defer to my betters
To say that once I ran a circuit of
St. Mark's place


Shaking bystanders by their shoulders
Lingered on the steps of Union Square
Loitered Grand Central littered
With the conversations of strangers
Where I watched people board trains
I wish I could run after
That Fort Tryon
And Riverside Drive
And Battery Park
Are full of youthful ghosts
And patches of grass
Where you watch the summer sun
Sink below the Hudson
There is no substance in this city
Only light and form
A nexus of tenuous thinks
Nebulous
The veins of the subway or
The grid lines of the avenues
But there is nowhere to go
'February House'
'The Chelsea Hotel'
Only exist in our cultural subconscious
And I lay here dreaming


To say
'I am Lazarus come from the dead
Come back to tell you all
I shall tell you all'
And that I invent
Because of a chronic loneliness
In a city full of millions"
A pause
The stage light gives texture
To the contours of his face
As he waits for a slow and uncertain
But then courteous
And only sometimes if it is actually good
Raucous
Applause
The floorboards creak
Beneath the weight of his embarrassment
Offstage he gets a pat on the back
Outside KGB Bar
"Oh hey that was great!"
"Ya really loved it ya!
Really loved like ya
That one line
'Lonely men in shirt sleeves'"
And then later when he is alone
In his bedroom in the Bronx twilight thinks:
'No
That is not it at all
That is not what I meant at all'
