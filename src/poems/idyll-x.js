Milo taps away at his Macbook
Dark mode
Neon lines
Arcane characters
Fill the screen
His headphones clamped around his ears
They block out the world out while he
Churns through his
Spotify playlist
A clap on the shoulder –
Alex.
"Alex, man!"
Milo tugs the headphones off and
Lets them hang around his neck
"Jeez. You look wrecked."
Alex pulls up a chair next to Milo
At the dinner table turned hotdesk
White collar purgatory
They are the only ones in the railroad style
Workspace
The early morning light floods through
The wall to ceiling windows


Alex lifts his laptop out of his (Nomatic) backpack
Then lets out a sigh beneath his ribs
"Yeah, I was up pretty late.
I need to get a grip.
Weekend was shot.
Client demo's at noon.
And I have like ten Pull Requests
I have to review
Merge
Maybe rewrite
Because there's no time for pushback
And no one seems to get that
We should have these things called
'standards'"
Milo baits him
"Just don't write bugs, man,
No unit tests
No documentation
No containerization
(Docker scares the shit out of me)
Hell, all of my code is self-documenting
Open to interpretation
Closed for modification
Close to improvisation
At least we have a staging site


Not that we need it"
Alex takes it
"You're the reason why we have standards
Someone's going to hate you in five years
Some junior dev
Fresh out of college
When we've had our IPO
Or been acquired by some bigger fish"
Milo snorts
"Then it's Tinder for dog owners"
Turns back to his screen
"Dana okay?"
"She left."
"Shit, what?"
Alex has stopped typing
It is a trickle
He clicks mindlessly through the
Red and green minefield
Of forking paths
"Uhh, yeah,
She left a note


Said it didn't work
Couldn't work
Wanted more
Or something else--
It's not the first time"
"And if it's the last?"
"She wanted Tuscany
Not Williamsburg
Said I'm always here
Never *here*"
"Not Brooklyn Heights?"
"That's not the point--
It's all WiFi in a shoebox."
"Well, look,
You never were very good at your job
Engineer
Boyfriend..."
"But the code won't ship itself
So maybe we should build something else
Two devs and dream, right?"


"Yeah.
And then we sell for forty mill."
