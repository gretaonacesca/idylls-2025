const text = `Faye pinches the phone between her ear
And the crook of her neck,
"Did I tell you I tried to hire an Etsy witch?"
An uncomfortable laugh on the other line,
"Like, a witch off of Etsy?"
– "Ya."
A little incredulous, with a hint of gravity –
"Huh."
A drawn out inhale –
"Did it work?"
– "You know, I saw the price,
And I thought:
'Fuck it, we'll do it live.'"

Faye scrolls down the page,
A heading
"Binding Spell to Get Back Your Ex"
On Pinterest
The text
Advises working within the planetary hours
When the moon waxes
When it is full
Venus well-aspected
Pluto in transit


"On a piece of paper
Write a letter
Address it to yourself
Put on the voice of
The one who left
Say all of the things they would say
Were they in the room with you
Say they're sorry, say they're sad
Say the words that bind them to you."
Faye digs through her backpack for a Muji pen
And an unchristened moleskine.
She musters most of her concentration
On the page (not very much)
In her mind's eye, Aidan, there
In front of her
Standing
His arms hang limp at his sides
In his clueless way of carrying himself
"Hey, Faye.
I'm really sorry."
Aidan (a Sagittarius, Faye, a Pisces)
Even in her mind
Was never very eloquent –
"I didn't mean to hurt you when I said, like,
You should move to Brooklyn


Get a better job
Stop being so stuck on your family
Like, I really need someone who's mature
Like, career-oriented (he has a finance job),
Wears more make-up
Like, you really let yourself go
But I love you
And I want to come back
And make this work."
She gets up, letter in hand, bisects the room and
Sitting across from the shell of herself she reads
A deluded, hopeless confession aloud
In an alto, slightly caricatured
San Diego vocal fry –
"Hey, Faye,
I'm really sorry,
I didn't mean to hurt you..."
It is, suddenly, all too human
And like that Faye begins to sob
Robbed of her years, dazed,
Wounded,
Sifting simultaneously through the words
Looking for something to make worthwhile
The tit-for-tat months-long death knell
She never knew was unfolding
And every other sentence she chokes up on


The geometry of his face
The melody of his voice
And at once she is a beam of light shining through
The surface of
A pail of water shaken through
Splashing this way, that way
Pale in the face of
His glowing apparition
She overflows
And all at once
She is composed
Stuffs herself back in at the seams
Douses the letter with
The cologne he bought before he left
She gets up, goes over to the kitchen window where the fire escape is
Climbs out and sits atop the rusting skyline
Of the November evening
Sparks a lighter
Lights the corner of the letter
Aflame in the electric-glow evening of BedStuy
Watching in a remorseful panic
As it burns all the way down
A molten blossom
To the sidewalk below
*


There is a long pause on the phone –
"Faye? Did it work?"
A blue note
– "Not exactly."
