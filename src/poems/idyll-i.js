const text = `"Funny seeing you here"
Ted lumbers over the terraced steps
Stops and drops onto one knee
Undoing the clasps of his guitar case,
"Ah, look, the man with the blue guitar,"
Says the busker,
"'Play us a tune beyond ourselves',
I'm done for the day,
And it's not my usual spot anyway."
Shutting the saxophone case with a stomp.
Ted sits down on the worn park bench
The August afternoon fading into Autumn evening
"What do you want to hear?"
The busker –
"Whatever happened to Danny?
Haven't seen him around
The last few weeks.
His spot over there,
By the obelisk,
You know –"
"Yeah,"
Ted sucked his teeth,
"He, uhh,"
His capo in his left hand


He caps the neck on the fifth fret
"He overdosed."
A bird chirps on a branch overhead
"Huh. Jesus."
The busker straightens up
Sobered up by the news
"Huh."
A narrowed look
A little more somber, this time
"He was young."
"Yep."
A couple of joggers pass by
Skimming the tension off the conversation
The clock on the skyline of 14th street
A digital plexus, ticks away
Somewhere down Broadway the sun is sinking
"Sing something for him, then,"
Ted wipes his brow with the back of his hand
Loosens up
Begins to strum
Something hollow
Something hallow
A melody somewhere distant
Like a face or name you see in passing
Tapping his foot
Keeping time
Humming beneath his breath


"There was this one song
Danny was working on
Back in May
'I'll be done by the end of the summer,'
He said
You remember that riff?"
The busker's eyes draw the vacant space by the obelisk,
"D minor..
B flat..
F–
something like that,"
"He said he'd put lyrics to it
It had that – that –"
He picks the strings with his right hand
As his left slides up and down the neck
"Yeah, it did,"
"And it was about that girl,
Brunette, 5'2",
Cooper Union MFA –
He'd watch her walk down Broadway,
Day in, day out
Back up, take the L to Brooklyn –
what was her name?"
The busker squints, imagining her silhouette
In the distance,
"Faye?"
