const text = `It looked like a desolate parking lot
Save the thin tin-roof shack at street-level
"Play it cool,
My friend's DJ-ing."
The bouncers dig in their usual way
'Who-are-you-here-to-see',
'Have-you-ever-been-here-before',
Adonis is squeamish when sober
But after a few drinks he forgets
That he is awkward and timid
He had only just met Hercules
When Hercules and his friends picked him up
At a bar in Bushwick
And what did it matter?
Reagan was busy
Collaborating with a Pratt professor
On some personal project
That didn't require her to answer
Adonis' texts
And he was out
On his own


One drink became two became four
An indefinite dyad
Logarithmic in consumption
"We're going to Basement if you want to come"
Half an invitation was all Adonis needed
They were older
Ten years his senior at least
But he'd always wanted to go
And he had nowhere to be
There was nowhere to be
He was never allowed in his father's bedroom;
In his father's bedroom there was an altar
To Elegua
His father was the kind of man
Who wore only white
Did not drink
Only during cleansing rituals
Would he smoke a dark cigar
They wait in line for half an hour
Walk across a silent courtyard
The bunker door swings open
And it is suddenly all
Smoke
Red light


A pulse
That comes from
Nowhere but circulates about the room
Packed to the brim with sweating bodies
Even in January the atmosphere is oppressive
Hercules takes his hand
And
Along with the rest of the band
They weave through the crush
A throughline through the waves
Of leather straps
Tanktops
Bare skin
Too hot down there for clothes
The club is an EDM catacomb
"You really have to let yourself feel it"
Hercules shouts muffled in his ear
Waving his arms and twisting his torso
Adonis scans the room
The closest you could come to
Berghain on the East coast
The center is a vortex of limbs
Into which Adonis is led by the hand


Stumbling
Somewhat hazy
Like a deer startled on a mountain track
Unaware of its own footing
As the ground gives way
Underneath
But Hercules leads him firm
The adjacent room is the "Play Room"
It smells of fear and longing
Proteins coagulating
And someone in need of a shower
Or a confessional
But Adonis is too bashful
He shoots a sidelong glance to see
If he might catch a glimpse
But
The Play Room door swings shut
And suddenly he thinks back
To his first encounter
Backstage
The opening night of his
Sophomore drama club production of
The Bacchae
Back then he did not know what bodies did


He did not know masculine
Could mean also mean tender
It was the sort of thing that
Lingered in a longing way
As if there were truths about himself that
He did not realize
No better place than in darkness
Safe in the haven of
These cavernous confines
All eyes down here were friendly
He takes his shirt off
Scrawny he smiles
His chest slackens
He can breathe again
And he contorts in that way he used to
Around the sprinklers at the center of the park
Hercules and his friends roar
A proud erastes in these rites
The miasma that was
The atmosphere of the club
Gives way to a chill that runs
Along his shoulders
His chest


His hair stands on end
He can feel
The molten lead rivulets
Of the longful gaze
Hercules grabs the scruff of his neck
Like a pup
Holds Adonis' head to his chest
He listens to the drumbeat in 3/4
That says
"You are mine –
Not to hold
But to shield."
Outside in polyester tents
They smoke cigarettes
On picnic benches
"So, what do you think?"
When his older brother Luis
Came out as gay
Their father cut him off like a limb
Hardly old enough to have his own roots
"It's a really good time!"
Says Adonis an octave too high
His voice is thin


When he needs to shout
It betrays his youth
Adonis sits next him
And as they talk about nothing at all
Adonis' polaroids
Hercules' advertising firm
The way gay men only need to lock eyes
He feels himself fracture
Into a beloved
Into an object of unrealised affection
Like when Hercules laughs and puts his arm
Around Adonis' waist
Or clasps his knees like a suppliant
He had never known what it was to
Be attracted to
Be attractive to
Someone who could break him if he wanted
There are flecks of grey in Hercules' beard
But his eyes betray a youth
That never lost its shimmer
"Let's go get a drink."
Hercules holds the vertex of his shoulder
And they go off alone


Inside
Adonis blinks
Red
Black
Red
Black
His head is heavy as
He stands outside the women’s bathroom
Catching his breath, hand against the wall
Which is damp with condensation
Or something more intimate
He blinks
And the crowd collapses in on itself –
A folding of limbs into shadow
Music into tremor
A boy into blur
Someone brushes past him –
A stranger, or maybe Hercules,
Or maybe the first boy
Who ever looked at him too long
And called it a joke
He opens his mouth to say something –
His name?


A word?
– but the bass swallows it whole
The strobe light catches his cheekbone
His shoulder
The place where a hand might’ve been
"Hey, are you okay?"
Several hands drag him into
The women's bathroom
And he lets himself sink
Into the dark
Hercules tears through the nameless multiplicity
Torn in two
"Adonis!
Adonis!"
But he's nowhere to be found
As Adonis is cradled
In the lap of a mini-skirt
His after-hours daimon
Halfway between Brooklyn and 5 AM
"Are you okay?"
She asks, faintly
And he closes his eyes
