const text = `I think I might die
Ascending the orange stairwell
A pigeon flies into me
"Jesus fucking Christ!"
On the side of the overpass
Down the flow of traffic
It's just warehouses out here
With some residential buildings
A pizzeria
A deli
Not a soul in sight save
The Greenpointers
Spilling out of their Ubers
A rusted door swings open
This must be it
This warehouse is a Silenus statue
The outside is industrial decay
On the inside there is the alternate reality of
The edge-case
East village
Not-Dimes-Square
Greenpoint
Fantasy for which I had longed
A band on the first floor


Hypnotic handrums
Stirrs something ancient in my blood
Smooth jazz on the second
The walls of the adjoining rooms are splattered
With paintings and photographs for sale
Margot finds me in the midst of the din
Out of place, my hands in my pockets as I sip
Water from a paper cup
We lock eyes
"Hey! It's been a while!"
I am suddenly at ease
We catch up
It has been a while
We talk around subjects
Epitomize the last several months
I defrost under the red-light lamplight
I ask to see her work, she ushers me into
The adjoining room, into the far right corner
Where four framed photographs are stacked
"It's titanium palladium."
"What's that?"
I watch her greet and be greeted by
Names and faces
It is nice


They are nice
This poet, that photographer
Something about the Vietnam War
I feel like an anthropologist
I am self-conscious
But happy to lurk in her orbit
An unassuming awkward
I am a cardboard silhouette of myself
Shake hands
Smile
Exchange pleasantries
Like tokens or
Micro-transactions
When Nick is there
I sneak a polaroid of them
I keep it in my coat pocket
Watching them is like seeing a negative
They wear matching beanies
"I feel like I can't really be honest about how I feel at these things."
We trade existential ennuis
Like men in their thirties
"Which one do you like?"
A girl looks down a concrete staircase
A white dress, navy bow around her waist


Her feet feel tacked on
Two-dimensional
Stuck on at wrong angles
A blonde in her twenties is gorging herself
In a Chinatown loft
Photo-realistic
About to burst into tears or puke
I am embarrassed in the third person
It is spaghetti (he is the spaghetti guy)
But I am ashamed of being in a body
A woman poses half-naked in a white button down
She strikes something seductive on the bed of
A Marriott or generic middle class hotel chain
There are several schizophrenic
Talentless pieces which
I am too bored to describe
"Chaos is the hypokeimenon of existence!"
I crack
In my Jordan Peterson voice
As we three lounge on a couch in the corner
And peoplewatch for a while
The second floor is a different kind of same
"The vibe is totally different up here."


Someone's beat up Fender warps
As a saxophone croons
And the evanescent patrons mill about
"This is my wife's first show."
"Are you an artist?"
"I work in sales
But I dabble in watercolour."
He offers me a hit from his wax pen
I regret not taking him up on it
After some time we
Walk to the G
On Greenpoint Ave
"I think I'll shuffle on a while"
We exchange our goodbyes
I watch them descend the steps to the G
Back towards civilization
In the East Village
Waiting street-level for the fading rumble
And I then stumble on
Along Greenpoint Ave
Greenpoint is a Silenus statue
