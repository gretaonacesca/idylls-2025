const text = `The phone rings out
As he walks along the Brooklyn Bridge
Below the East River shimmers
And kicks up petulant waves beneath
The lone light of the moon above
A beep
"Hey, Amara!
I was just calling to, uhh..."
He tugs the collar of his coat up
Looks down at the water
Shoves his hands deeper into
His pockets as if
To fish out –
"Call me back!"
*
He walks along MacDougal Street
Leaving behind the long-stretched shadow
Of the arch in Washington Square
That supports the weight of the sky
The heat breaks as the sun
Abandons its aestival course
He dials her number
It rings


And rings
And rings
And
A beep –
"Amara, hey...
Listen.
Can we talk?
I haven't heard from you in weeks
And I keep
Thinking like we didn't really get
The chance
To talk about us..."
He pauses
"All you had to do was say the word
If you'd said
Something
At least
Then I'd understand
Like all you had to say
That night in Washington Square was
'Hey,
I'm not in a place
Where I can give you what you want
Or really what you need
I like you
I like this
But it's becoming too much for me


Right now
And I'm not
Saying 'Never'
Just 'Not now'
'Not like this'
Okay?'
And it'd be okay
And I'd be okay..."
He passes Cafe Reggio and sees
The silhouette of himself and her
The auburn of her hair
In a bun as she talks about her time
Translating Ming Dynasty poetry
For her MA at Bard
"And I wouldn't be thinking
'I moved to FiDi to look at fucking
Spreadsheets bursting with
Fund umbrellas
Shareclasses
Because a girl I met upstate
Lured me down here
Into the central circle of
White-collar Hell
And then
Ghosted me"


And she leans in and asks
"Are you still reading that
Anne Carson book I got you?
'Autobiography of Red’?
Or do you not like women
Who don't think you're smart
And interesting?"

On the corner of Metropolitan
He sits on a ledge in the back patio of
A pool-supply store turned haven to
Indie musicians who never made it
Finance-bros who've become sentient
The odd art student who got lost
On their way back to the East Village
The crowd surges at 2 AM on a Saturday
He surveys the room
And after the fourth or fifth drink
Amara walks in
They lock eyes in the tumult
And he is seen right through
He doesn’t call out
Doesn't say 'Hello'


But smiles a sheepish half-small
And looks away
Outside
As he stumbles away from the bar
He dials a number
It rings
And rings –
"Hey," he says.
"Hey?"
Says a voice
"What's up?"
Half-asleep on the other end
"You good?"
"Yeah," he says,
"You were right, Rowan."
Rowan scoffs
"You gave it your best shot
But it's time to let go –
You owe yourself as much"
