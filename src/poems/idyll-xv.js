const text = `Tess holds her phone to her face.
Presses the buzzer three or four times.
Looks up at the fire escape on the second floor.
“Faye! Faye!”
She shouts in this shrill, playful tone.
Faye pushes past the inner door,
Swings out the heavy wooden one
That guards the brownstone.
“Shut the fuck up!”
She grins in an equally exuberant cry—
That long, drawn-out,
Somewhat whiny noise
You find from girls in their early (to mid) twenties.
Faye lunges into an embrace,
Practically tackles Tess.
Tess can smell the alcohol on her breath;
Her hair is slightly damp but warm.
They nearly stumble off the stoop
And saunter down the steps to the L
On Jefferson Street,
Right around the corner.


Tess hides a glass bottle
In a brown bag
Under her trench coat.
As they swipe,
Slide down the stairwells,
Waiting for Godot on the uptown platform,
They pass it back and forth
In silent communion.
The semester is ending soon.
Faye is working on a master copy of The Kiss.
She talks about the dissolution of boundaries,
Spirituality and ecstasy –
That gold cannot be painted,
Only implied.
Tess thinks Klimt is decadent.
Prefers Las Meninas.
Velázquez refuses illusion.
Flesh is flesh, light is light.
She is iconoclastic in her devotion to
The Gaze.
They both long to be seen in their own right.
“You never really knew Adonis, did you?”


Tess asks.
Faye squints, a little askew.
“Uhh… I met him once at a party…
In some Chinatown loft.
And we talked about photography –
He was nice –
I think he was hitting on me.”
Tess:
“We were in each other’s orbit a while.
‘Oh-you-know-Adonis-too.’
The gallery openings.
The social clubs.
You show up, you get seen.
You experiment…”
*
Through the single-paned white saloon doors,
The room pulses as people
Wind their way through the spotlights
Around pedestals of gnarled metalwork,
Seashells in Pompeiian mosaics,
Terrariums preserved in epoxy.
A fragmented self-portrait


Disintegrates at the vertices.
On a side wall,
A series of oversaturated black and white photographs:
Mott Haven or Kingsbridge –
Some obscure province of the Bronx.
In the back,
A projector beams an image
Of a shirtless teen
Doing hula-hoops.
He smiles through his braces.
LONG LIVE ADONIS
Flashes,
Then dissolves into the iMovie scenescape.
“Did all these people really know him?”
“I think he managed to get around.
Or the word got out.
But it doesn’t really matter.”
“They fill in the space he left behind.”
“Ya.”


“So much untapped potential.
Like – it’s not good.
Like, it’s hardly art.
It’s just, like… interesting.”
“Ya – but it could have been great.
It’s interesting.
Like – the materials and the novelty.
And it’s got elements of composition”
On a neighboring table,
There’s a series of Polaroids
Laid out in a polymer tapestry,
Scattered helter-skelter:
The same smile.
Graffiti murals.
Red brick projects.
A circle gathers around Adonis
As he contorts and flails
In a graceful, misdirected frenzy
Around the sprinkler
At the center of an asphalt park.
His twenty-first birthday party
In the living room of his


Two-bedroom, first-generation apartment.
“His death is curated better than my fucking life.”
“Oh, hey, Reagan!”
Tess and Faye now kiss and coo:
“Oh-my-God-hey,
So-good-to-see-you,
So-glad-you-showed-up.”
Reagan:
“I’m really glad we
Were able to put this on for him.
You know, he always wanted to be in a show.
We were going to do a salon series…”
Faye:
“Ya, ya. He deserves it. Really, ya.”
Tess:
“Yeah, he really matured in his form.
Like—you can see the evolution in his thought.
The way he changes materials over time…
Nothing feels out of place.”


Reagan:
“Yeah, I remember when he started
‘Switching it up.’
Getting more ‘crafty.’
Playing with memory and preservation.
And epoxy.
Pictures to metalworks to terrariums.
Urban decay, you know.
Like when we were dating…
He really influenced me as an artist.”
*
Of course, not everyone is an enthusiast.
“Yo, the women out here are crazy.”
Tess overhears some stupefied leer.
Nearly crushes the plastic wine cup in her hand.
“Ya, mhm, uh-huh, ya.”
*
“Reagan’s so full of shit,”
Says Tess, grinding her cigarette into a ledge.


“They only dated for like a month
Before she slept with some professor from Pratt.”
“Ya, mhm…”
Says Faye,
Looking down at her shoes.
