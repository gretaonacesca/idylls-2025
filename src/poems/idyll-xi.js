const text = `There is no cure for love, Iakobus--
No pill nor potion nor oil nor salve,
Save the Muses,
But a sweet and gentle cure it is,
Albeit hard for mortal men to find,
As you know well, I trow, being a physician,
Knowing what it is that they know,
And you being as dear to them as I myself,
Twas this much my countryman the Cyclops
Polyphemus gleaned,
When he was in love with the nymph Galatea,
Being about the age you are now;
His love was no matter of poems, or gifts,
Or apples,
But an unbridled frenzy--
He thought little of anything else,
And time and time again would cast his longing
Into the sea,
Neglecting his work at the MTA,
Which long would sit piled on his desk,
Amidst gripe and jeer and jest,
He languished under an irate, bureaucratic glare,
As long as the slender barb of the Cyprian
Stood fixed in his breast,
Though he found a cure eventually,
And so stood on the on the shore of Battery Park,
Where the 5 train rests at the edge of the world,


And there alone at the rails above the waters,
Sang of her some such thing as this:
"O Galatea,
Girl with springtime eyes,
As fair as shore to storm-tossed sailors is,
And cool water in August's heat,
You, a shining star of this island,
There will never be another
maid such as you.
What is it that keeps you from me?
Whither do you go when the sun sets?
What drives you forth from my bed?
I sleep alone in a studio enough for two,
Off of Broadway and 12th St.,
When the Pleiades have set, and you
Nowhere to be seen.
I have loved you, girl, since that first day
We met for coffee uptown
at a hole in the wall diner,
And since that day have never ceased to love–
O Zeus, what does it matter?
I know why it is you flee.
I've got a long shag brow stretched from ear to ear,
And one large eye that sits beneath,
And a broad nose for good measure,
Upon my lip,
A limp,
A wretch,
But just as I am I make a good salary,
With benefits to boot,


And have a respectable living,
Serving the citizens of this city.
Wealth isn't more, but less, more or less,
And with what I earn, I make do,
And of all my needs, natural and necessary,
Though there are so few,
What needs have I, really?
What need have I--save you?
My garden yields a feast,
Of table greens and nightshades and legumes,
My pantry ever overflows,
My almond milk I make myself,
My labor feeds me through winter,
And I've got a few grand saved up,
For any expense ahead--
And I play the lyre like none of the other Cyclopes,
And oftentimes at night I sing of you,
Sweet apple, and myself,
But if my singing won't do,
I'll get us a couple of mezzanine seats,
For a Broadway musical,
Any you wish will do--
One about New York, I hear, is playing,
And isn't that fitting?
But come away to me and you'll have no less,
Just come and see what this island can offer--
Sleeping beneath the starless sky,
In a room with peeling wallpaper,
Where the rent is high,
The expectations higher,


But so will be your fame,
Prithee, girl, come hither,
Leave that swamp behind.
If only some stranger would sail here
On some black ship,
With white-splashing oars,
And teach me how to swim,
I'd swim to you, then, from here
Around Brooklyn's bend, Bay Ridge,
Past Canarsie, and straight to that
Provincial town of yours
On stilts over the water.
It would be faster than the A train, anyway,
And who takes the Qm15, anyhow?
Ah, κυκλωψ κυκλωψ ποι πεπετασαι τας φρένας?
Ah, only myself to blame,
I, here, a noone on land,
What purpose have I but sunrise and sunset?
No art, no craft,
Clock in, clock out;
I wander this city in a daze,
Like a wounded deer on slender tracks--
I get no rest,
Vexed coming, vexed going,
The subway rattles along still
On rusty tracks,
There is no joy in my life,
No pleasure in sight or sound,
And everything a shade of grey,


To this monoptic view.
If only I were a skilled physician,
I would treat this raging fever,
Or a sorcerer,
I would burn some sage,
And cast some such spell,
'Wryneck, wryneck, draw her hither,'
But what am I
But a bucolic bore with a desk-job
And a Muse?
Cyclops, listen here, Cyclops,
Can't you see you're daft?
Don't you know you've got the girl?
And don't stand in need of the draft,
Of a fine tail-wind to send you adrift,
Or the hull of a black ship, stranger-sent,
To carry you to her,
There are much stranger things
To have happened in this city,
Than to have loved and to have got,
So waste not a second at the seashore,
Take a bus or train, ferry even,
Walk if need be,
Your love can carry you anywhere,
Or heaven forbid you drive,
Contrive something, anything,
It doesn't matter what,
You've got your lot, Cyclops."


So it was that Polyphemus consoled his love-sickness,
In the end,
By realizing he had the very thing
He thought he lacked,
And in truth, he fared better than if he had paid
A co-pay to some such as yourself,
Iakobus.
