const text = `The Idylls is about ghosts.
The form owes itself to Theocritus, who pioneered the literary genre in
3rd-century BCE Sicily. His idylls were fragments of agrarian life—goatherds,
rival singers, the rough textures and small dramas of the countryside. Quiet,
earthy, often mournful.
To him I owe the form. And only spiritually, the content. Most of these are
reimaginings – adaptations in a different key. Where he had the pastoral, I have
the post-modern. His hills are my boroughs.
We differ geographically. These idylls are about New York City.
They’re about some of my friends. Or versions of them. Or strangers I’ve
invented as I walk past them on the street, or long to know them. They’re
attempts to grasp at a version of the city I always dreamed of but never quite
found – a city humming with memory and meaning, late-night heartbreaks
and overheard monologues, half-finished songs and subway revelations.
A city full of ghosts, and the people who try to love them.`
