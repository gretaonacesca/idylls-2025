const text = `"It always begins
And ends
With long walks
The kind where you walk
The length of Central Park
Or Riverside Drive,"
Says Danny
"That's right", says Ted
His guitar case rocks to and fro
On his back with every step
"Is this it?"
"I... think... so..."
Danny, checking his phone
Squinting into the whitewash blindness
His pupils the heads of pins
They ascend the steps to the manor house
Rick greets them at the door
He is dressed in a white button down
The felt on the lapel of his suit jacket indicates
That Ted and Danny are
Wildly underdressed
In their black turtlenecks


"Hey, good to see you, man,
Hey, nice to meet you,
Come in – there's wine in the back"
Past the cocktail dresses
Charcoal suits with no ties
They shuffle disoriented
Surrounded by international heirlooms
"That's a Vermeer,"
Someone whispers loudly over a pinot noir
They smear the marble floors of the kitchen
With the cuffs of their grass-bled khakis
"Red or white?" Asks the waiter
"Wh-red..." fumbles Danny
Ted asks if the vintage is from southern France
"It's from Northern Spain"
"Oh"
They both begin drinking for effect
"Thank you all for coming"
Rick who can cast a spell on a room
Herds the cats in their midtown suits to their seats
"Tonight I have here Anna
She curates
The Medici stringed instrument collection
Currently on display
At the Met
On loan


From the Uffizi Gallery
In Florence"
Anna discourses on
The evolution of stringed instruments
From the middle ages through
The Italian Renaissance
"Is that a lute?" whispers Danny
Following the discourse Rick
Sits at a baby Grand
In the center of the room
Around which are seated
Students from Juilliard
Lawyers
Doctors
This AI researcher at
[Big Name Tech Company]
This guy who is a portfolio manager at
[Big Name Investment Firm]
The several Tinder dates he's been on
That he's been trying to keep apart
All night
That guy or this girl whom you recognize
But are loathe to say the wrong name
So you linger on questions and wait
For them to be addressed
By someone else


"Get this," Danny says in Ted's ear
Danny was once blinded by Rick
In a TriBeca loft
When he lay waste
To the room
With his performance of Mad Rush
The long soporific repetition punctuated
By bursts of airy assonance circles
Back to delay and relay swirls
Haste with tedium
Breathless
In the light of the evening sun
And now Rick
No longer blinds
but curates
Adjusts the light
His performance is the room itself
As he weaves through
Venetian Boat Song
Op. 19, No. 6
You see yourself looking through
A slit
In the wall of
The Bridge of Sighs
At the waterfront of
The Palazzo Ducale


He plays the guests
Like oscillating arpeggios
Ted watches from the periphery
Still rocking slightly
His guitar case creaking
Like a guilty conscience
Danny has stopped checking his phone
The battery died hours ago
So did his hope of
whatever he was hoping for
In the aftermath of the performance
The guests linger on the walls
Like salamanders
"What do you do?"
"Oh how do you know Rick?"
"Do you play anything?"
Ted begins to introduce himself as Rick
The juxtaposition of
The broke Juilliard student
And the CEO of a well-known fitness company
Class disparity in miniscule
Is overturned
By her relative finesse on the piano
Chiaroscuro is obscured
By a common bond
Of quiet devotion


Restless internal
To Euterpe
The Juilliard girl—
Yes, she plays the closing piece
A short, clipped étude
By a forgotten student of Scarlatti
Which somehow says more
Than the long lecture
Or the wine
Or the Vermeer looking down at you
Or Rick himself
A pause
As she lays flat
The final keys
Then scattered clapping
Like a breeze that scatters
Dying leaves
And then erupts
Into a whirlwind
"Did you see her hands?"
Danny says, finally
"Like spiders. Or angels."
*


It is long after the performance
Everyone's collars are unbuttoned
Ties undone
Sleeves rolled up
Empty wine bottles scattered
Atop the kitchen counters
Danny is performing smalltalk
With a waifish cocktail dress
Mentioning "scordatura"
As if he knows what that means
As Ted
Stares at the shrubs in the garden
Through puffs of cigarette smoke
There is a knock on the door
"Rick? Where's Rick?"
Demands a voice
It is suddenly pandemonium
As a band of ten or fifteen storm the house
Led by Alex
With violets in her hair
"Rick get the fuck out here!"
They crowd about the drawing room
And the scene collapses in on itself
As they laugh and cajole about the tables


And the late hours are consumed
By foment and argument
And sudden riffing off
Each others lines or notes
As they play and sing and yell
Someone spills wine on the Vermeer
(Which is fine
It wasn't real anyway)
Alex kicks off her shoes
And lobs Ted's guitar
Into someone's lap
"Play something real," she says
"None of this 'classical' shit."
She kisses one of Rick's exes
Someone cheers
Rick appears, finally
The spell broken
Shirt half-unbuttoned
Barefoot like a penitent
The Juilliard girl is on the floor now
Playing something feral on the violin
Her bow splitting in the fray


Someone knocks over a table
Shatters a vase
Rick is unfazed
All the tidy distinctions—
Artist and patron
Host and guest
Performer and observer—
Collapse in crescendo
And for a moment
The night is tuned
In perfect scordatura
*
Back on Riverside Drive
The sky is a lavender blended
With streaks of gold
The air is crisp as it folds
The grass in sheets
They walk
Along the Hudson
Watch the water run downstream
Past the morning dog walkers
"It always begins
And ends


With long walks..."
Says Danny
